# Flowmag Dataset Collection

Set the root directory to store data in `scripts/prepare_data.sh` and run `sh scripts/prepare_data.sh` to collect the dataset named `flowmag_data` under the root directory. The default directory is `./data`. Please ensure that your root directory has sufficient storage space.
